title: Zones
---

Zones allow you to define a specific area of the frame and apply additional filters for object types so you can determine whether or not an object is within a particular area. Zones cannot have the same name as a camera. If desired, a single zone can include multiple cameras if you have multiple cameras covering the same area by configuring zones with the same name for each camera.

During testing, enable the Zones option for the debug feed so you can adjust as needed. The zone line will increase in thickness when any object enters the zone.

To create a zone, follow [the steps for a "Motion mask"](/configuration/masks), but use the section of the web UI for creating a zone instead.
